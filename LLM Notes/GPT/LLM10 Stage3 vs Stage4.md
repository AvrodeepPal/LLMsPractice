Great thinking! You're absolutely on track with **Stage 3: LSTM-based time series forecasting (MemoryLLM)** and **Stage 4: Transformer-based models (CodeLLM)** in your custom LLM roadmap.

## üîÅ Stage 3 vs. üöÄ Stage 4 (LSTM vs. Transformer)

Here's a **deep dive comparison**, both **generally** and **applied to your GOOG price prediction project**.

### ‚úÖ **Generalized Comparison: LSTM (Stage 3) vs. Transformer (Stage 4)**

| Feature | Stage 3: LSTM (Recurrent) | Stage 4: Transformer (Attention) |
|--------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Architecture** | Sequential, time-step based recurrence | Fully parallel via attention mechanism |
| **Memory** | Recalls short-term context via hidden state | Captures long-term dependencies via attention |
| **Parallelization** | Poor (step-by-step) | Excellent (process all tokens/time steps at once) |
| **Training Time** | Slower due to recursion | Faster due to full parallelism |
| **Data Need** | Performs well with smaller datasets | Thrives on large datasets |
| **Explainability** | Harder to interpret | Easier to visualize attention weights |
| **Use Case Fit** | Time-series, sequential tasks | Language, code, multi-modal, time series too (via patches or tokens) |
| **Pretraining** | Rare; models usually trained from scratch | Abundant pretrained models (BERT, GPT, etc.) |

### üß† Could We Have Used Pretrained LLMs Here?

#### üí¨ **Short Answer**:
Technically yes, but it depends **how** we frame the problem.

#### ‚ú≥Ô∏è **Two Possible Ways to Use Pretrained LLMs**:

1. **As a Feature Extractor**:
   - Use LLMs like GPT, BERT, or FinBERT to extract semantic meaning from **news headlines**, **tweets**, or **financial reports** alongside price data.
   - Combine text embeddings with stock indicators for richer inputs to an LSTM or Transformer.

2. **As a Time-Series Model (FinGPT-like)**:
   - There are financial LLMs like [FinGPT](https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinGPT) that fine-tune Transformer-based architectures **specifically for financial prediction**.
   - However, they often require **massive data**, pretraining, and careful tokenization (dates, prices, etc.).

### üß™ How Would Using a Transformer Change the Workflow?

#### üì¶ **Architecture Changes**:
Instead of feeding data step-by-step (like `lookback=60` days to predict the next), you:
- Represent the **entire sequence as a "sentence"**.
- Add **positional encodings** to maintain time order.
- Apply **multi-head attention** layers, feed-forward, and output layers for prediction.

#### üîß **Coding Changes**:
You would:
- Use a Transformer encoder/decoder model (e.g., from PyTorch or Keras)
- Flatten your sequences into token-like input vectors.
- Add positional encodings.
- Train using MSE loss just like LSTM, but the model would attend globally to all positions.

#### üìä **Performance Differences**:
- **Accuracy**: Transformers may outperform LSTM on complex datasets (long sequences, multivariate features).
- **Interpretability**: You can **visualize attention maps** to see what days influence today‚Äôs price.
- **Scalability**: Transformer handles more features/days better, but needs more GPU and RAM.

### üîÑ Stage 3 (LSTM) Recap ‚Äì Strengths & Weaknesses:

| ‚úÖ Strengths | ‚ùå Weaknesses |
|-------------|--------------|
| Easy to implement | Can't capture long-range dependencies |
| Requires less compute | Slow to train (step-by-step) |
| Good for small datasets | Doesn't scale well |
| Works well with daily price data | Hard to debug / interpret hidden state |

---

### üöÄ Stage 4 (Transformer) Preview ‚Äì Strengths & Weaknesses:

| ‚úÖ Strengths | ‚ùå Weaknesses |
|-------------|--------------|
| Captures **global time dependencies** | Needs large training data or pretraining |
| Fast training (parallelizable) | More complex to build |
| Attention maps are interpretable | Needs more compute (GPU essential) |
| Scales well to multi-feature/time | Hard to adapt to low-data tasks without overfitting |

---

### üß† Real Example of Transformers in Finance:
- **FinGPT**: Open-source LLM trained on financial news + stock prices.
- **Informer** and **Autoformer**: Transformer variants designed for long-sequence time series forecasting.
- **TimeGPT**: Prophet-style but with attention-based architecture (e.g., by Nixtla).

### üîö Summary

| Aspect | Stage 3 (LSTM) | Stage 4 (Transformer) |
|--------|----------------|------------------------|
| Works well with | Short to mid-length sequences | Long sequences with rich dependencies |
| Suitability | Daily stock price with 5‚Äì10 indicators | Multi-variate, multi-modal (e.g., text + price + time) |
| Scalability | Moderate | High |
| Pretraining Availability | Rare | Plentiful (FinGPT, TimeGPT) |
| Next Logical Step | Upgrade to attention-based encoder-decoder with positional encodings | Integrate news/text via LLMs |
