# 📘 Stage 4 Professional Standards Brochure: Transformer-Based Time Series Modeling

---

## 🚀 Overview
Stage 4 of the LLM evolution marks the transition from RNN-based architectures (LSTM) to powerful Transformer-based models. This document outlines the rigorous professional standards required to ensure your Transformer models are not only accurate but also scalable, interpretable, and production-ready.

## 📊 1. Data Handling Standards

### ✅ Data Preprocessing
- Ensure chronological ordering and handling of missing values.
- Normalize or standardize numerical inputs.
- Encode temporal features (day, month, time-of-day) as needed.

### ✅ Feature Engineering
- Incorporate technical indicators: SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, etc.
- Create lag features or rolling statistics if applicable.

### ✅ Tokenization & Embeddings
- Use time series embeddings or positional encodings.
- Learnable embeddings for indicators, time features, or categorical variables.

---

## 🧠 2. Model Architecture Standards

### ✅ Base Architecture
- Use Transformer Encoder or Encoder-Decoder models.
- Include multi-head self-attention, feedforward layers, and normalization.

### ✅ Hyperparameters to Track:
- Number of layers, number of heads, embedding size, dropout rate.
- Positional encoding type: sinusoidal vs learnable.

### ✅ Positional Awareness
- Ensure temporal dependencies via proper position encoding.
- Support long sequence memory (via masking or segmenting).

---

## ⚙️ 3. Training Strategy Standards

### ✅ Optimization
- Use `AdamW` optimizer with learning rate warm-up.
- Apply gradient clipping to prevent exploding gradients.
- Consider label smoothing or custom forecasting losses.

### ✅ Data Handling
- Use padded batches with attention masks.
- Stratified split for time-series (no random shuffling).

### ✅ Training Utilities
- Implement early stopping.
- Use checkpoint saving.
- Track learning rate schedules.

---

## 📈 4. Evaluation & Interpretation Standards

### ✅ Metrics
- Use MAE, RMSE, MAPE, R2 for evaluation.
- Forecast horizon accuracy and rolling RMSE.

### ✅ Explainability
- Visualize attention scores for interpretation.
- Optional: SHAP values or saliency maps.

### ✅ Visualization
- Actual vs Predicted plots over time.
- Plot attention heatmaps (token-to-token importance).

---

## 🛠️ 5. Deployment & Production Standards

### ✅ Model Saving
- Save model weights, tokenizer, and positional encodings.
- Support resuming training from checkpoint.

### ✅ Inference Pipeline
- Build batch-friendly inference pipeline.
- Document expected input format.

### ✅ Benchmarking
- Compare inference time vs LSTM-based model.
- Test model performance under memory constraints.

---

## ✅ Bonus (Optional Enhancements)

- Use Longformer or Performer for long-sequence scalability.
- Use autoencoder-style Transformers for anomaly detection.
- Integrate prediction intervals using quantile regression.
