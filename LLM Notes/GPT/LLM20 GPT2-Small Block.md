Alright â€” letâ€™s **fully explain** this picture carefully and deeply.

# ðŸ“ˆ This is a schematic of GPT-2 architecture.

It shows **how the model processes tokenized text through a Transformer block 12 times** to generate output.

Let's break it down step by step:

---

# 1. **Input Stage**

- **Tokenized Text**:
  - You start with text ("The cat sat on the mat") â†’ tokenize it (turn words into integers).
  - Each token is an ID (like "the" â†’ 17, "cat" â†’ 1423, etc.).

---

- **Token Embedding Layer**:
  - Each token ID is mapped into a **dense vector** (e.g., 768-dimensional if small GPT-2).
  - Think: **token â†’ vector**.

---

- **Positional Embedding Layer**:
  - Transformers have no natural "order" notion (unlike RNNs), so we **add a vector** that tells the model "this is the 1st, 2nd, 3rd token", etc.
  - Final input = **token embedding + position embedding**.

---

- **Dropout**:
  - Regularization.
  - Randomly zeroes some values during training to prevent overfitting.

---

# 2. **Transformer Block (Repeated 12 Times)**

- This is the **blue box** repeated **12 times** in GPT-2.

Inside each block:

---

### 2.1 **First Sub-Layer â€” Masked Multi-Head Attention**

- **Masked** because GPT is a **decoder-only model** (can't "see" future tokens when predicting the next token).
- Multi-Head Attention lets model **focus on different parts** of the input sequence **simultaneously**.

**Before attention**:
- Apply **LayerNorm 1** to stabilize inputs.

**After attention**:
- **Dropout** applied.
- **Residual connection (+)** adds the original input (before attention) back to the output (after attention).

---

### 2.2 **Second Sub-Layer â€” Feed-Forward Network (FFN)**

- After attention, apply another:
  - **LayerNorm 2**.
  - **Feed Forward** subnetwork (typically 2 dense layers with GeLU in between).

**After FFN**:
- Again, **Dropout** applied.
- Another **residual connection (+)** adds input before FFN to the output after FFN.

---

### âœ¨ Important:
- **Each transformer block = two residual connections**:
  - One after Attention.
  - One after Feed-Forward.

- **Pre-LayerNorm architecture**: notice **LayerNorm before sublayer**, NOT after (good for deep stability).

---

# 3. **After 12 Transformer Blocks**

After passing through **12 stacked Transformer blocks**:

- Apply a **Final LayerNorm** to clean the representation one last time.

---

# 4. **Output Stage**

- **Linear Output Layer**:
  - Maps final vector for each token to a huge vocabulary size (e.g., 50,257 words in GPT-2 vocabulary).
  - Outputs logits (scores) for each possible next word.

- **Sampling**:
  - You sample from this distribution to pick the next word (e.g., using softmax, greedy decoding, top-k sampling, etc.).

# ðŸ“š Extra Small Details You See in the Picture:

| Thing in Picture | What it Means |
|:---|:---|
| 12Ã— | The whole blue Transformer block is repeated 12 times (GPT-2 small). |
| "+" | Shortcut connection (residual addition after sub-layer) |
| LayerNorm 1, 2 | Separate LayerNorms for Attention and FeedForward |
| Masked Attention | Attention is only over past tokens, not future ones |
| Final LayerNorm | Helps final outputs be well-scaled before prediction |
| Token Embedding + Positional Embedding | Together create the model input |

# ðŸ§  Important Why Transformer Blocks Are Repeated

- Repeating blocks lets the model build **progressively deeper and richer features**.
- Earlier blocks might learn:
  - Word relationships (syntax: subject-verb-object)
- Later blocks might learn:
  - Deep semantics (meaning: sarcasm, story progression, logical inference).

---

# ðŸ”¥ Bonus Fun Fact
- GPT-2 Small = 12 layers, 117M parameters
- GPT-2 Medium = 24 layers, 345M parameters
- GPT-2 Large = 36 layers, 762M parameters
- GPT-2 XL = 48 layers, 1.5B parameters

More layers = bigger model = deeper understanding = slower training ðŸ§ ðŸš€

# ðŸŽ¯ Conclusion
âœ… The diagram shows a **clear path** from tokenized input â†’ embedding â†’ 12Ã— Transformer â†’ output word prediction.
âœ… Shortcut connections are shown explicitly as (+) symbols.
âœ… LayerNorm comes **before** each sub-layer (Pre-Norm).
âœ… GPT-2 is a **decoder-only Transformer**, not encoder-decoder like the original Transformer.
