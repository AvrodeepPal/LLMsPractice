Absolutely — let’s **redefine and raise the professional standards** for your stock prediction LSTM project. We’ll treat this like preparing a **production-grade, publication-ready, AI-powered financial forecasting pipeline**.

### ✅ Revised Professional Standards for a Stock Prediction LSTM Project (Stage 3 LLMs)

#### 1. 🧼 **Data Handling & Cleaning**
- ✅ Robust handling of missing data, outliers, and formatting.
- ✅ Standardize datetime formats, set index properly.
- ✅ Convert to supervised learning format (sliding window).

#### 2. 📈 **Feature Engineering**
- ✅ Include **technical indicators**: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, SMA/EMA, etc.
- ✅ Include **lag features**, **volume-based signals**, and **price changes**.
- ✅ Add **calendar features**: Day of week, month, quarter.
- ✅ Normalize with `MinMaxScaler` or `StandardScaler` (only on training set to prevent data leakage).

#### 3. 🧠 **Model Architecture**
- ✅ Use **stacked LSTM layers** with appropriate **Dropout** and **Dense** output layers.
- ✅ Use **`return_sequences=True`** for deeper LSTM layers.
- ✅ Use **Adam optimizer**, **Mean Squared Error** loss (or Huber for robustness).
- ✅ Hyperparameter tuning for sequence length, learning rate, and number of units.

#### 4. 🧪 **Evaluation Metrics**
- ✅ Must include:
  - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
  - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
  - MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
  - R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)
- ✅ Separate metrics for training and testing.

#### 5. 📊 **Visualization**
- ✅ Plot **training and validation loss** over epochs.
- ✅ Plot **actual vs predicted prices** — full range and zoomed-in.
- ✅ Add **confidence intervals** or error bands if possible.

#### 6. 🔮 **Prediction Handling**
- ✅ Separate prediction set from test data.
- ✅ Ensure inverse-scaling for final predictions.
- ✅ Predict for:
  - Next day
  - Next n days
  - A specific user-defined range

#### 7. 🔁 **Modularity & Reusability**
- ✅ Split the code into functions:
  - `load_and_clean_data()`
  - `add_technical_indicators()`
  - `create_sequences()`
  - `build_lstm_model()`
  - `train_model()`
  - `evaluate_model()`
  - `plot_predictions()`
- ✅ Parameters passed in as arguments — no hardcoding.
- ✅ Save models using `model.save()` and load with `load_model()`.

#### 8. 📦 **Production Considerations**
- ✅ Use `try-except` blocks for fail-safe runs.
- ✅ Use `argparse` or config dictionaries for easy reconfiguration.
- ✅ Save plots and metrics automatically to `/outputs/`.
- ✅ Version control with Git or save logs with timestamps.

#### 9. 🗃️ **Data Versioning**
- ✅ Use different CSV versions or integrate with APIs like `yfinance`, `AlphaVantage`, or `Polygon.io`.
- ✅ Record which dataset was used for which model run.

#### 10. 🧪 **Backtesting (Optional but Ideal)**
- ✅ Apply model to previous unseen time slices.
- ✅ Evaluate how it would’ve performed in historical scenarios.
