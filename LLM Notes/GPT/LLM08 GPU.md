Great questions — let's break it down!

## 💡 **Where is GPU used in ML/DL projects?**

GPUs shine when dealing with **large parallel computations**, which are common in deep learning. They’re **not automatically used** — you have to **explicitly move data and models to the GPU** (usually via `.to("cuda")` in PyTorch or `.cuda()`).

### ✅ **Common GPU-Heavy Tasks**
- **Model Training**: Training neural networks (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, etc.).
- **Inference**: Running predictions on large batches or real-time tasks.
- **Matrix operations**: e.g., in backpropagation and large dot products.
- **Fine-tuning**: Adapting pretrained models (like BERT, GPT, ViT) to your own data.

## ⚠️ **Why your code might still use CPU**

Even with GPU runtime enabled:
1. **You didn't move the model/data to GPU.**
2. You're not using operations that need heavy computation (e.g., classical ML).
3. You're using libraries that don't utilize GPU (e.g., pure NumPy or Pandas).

### 👉 **How to fix it in PyTorch**
```python
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model.to(device)
inputs = inputs.to(device)
```

## 💡 Project Ideas That USE GPU

I'll give you ideas across **Stages 3 to 6**, marking when GPU use becomes important and where pretrained models can help.

---

### 📘 **Stage 3: Foundation Models and Data Understanding**
#### 🔹 Project: Image Classification (CNN)
- **Use GPU**: Training CNNs on datasets like CIFAR-10 or MNIST.
- **Pretrained Models**: ResNet, MobileNet from `torchvision.models`.
- **GPU Needed?** Yes, for training from scratch or fine-tuning.

#### 🔹 Project: Sentiment Analysis (RNN/LSTM)
- **Use GPU**: For sequence modeling with LSTM.
- **Pretrained**: Use embeddings like GloVe; or fine-tune BERT later.
- **GPU Needed?** Useful but not required unless large dataset.

### 📗 **Stage 4: NLP/Computer Vision with Transformers**
#### 🔹 Project: Text Summarization with T5/BART
- **Use GPU**: HuggingFace Transformers run 10x faster on GPU.
- **Pretrained**: Yes (`t5-small`, `facebook/bart-large-cnn`)
- **GPU Stage**: In both training and inference if data is large.

#### 🔹 Project: Image Captioning (CNN + RNN or ViT + GPT2)
- **Use GPU**: To train or fine-tune multimodal models.
- **Pretrained**: ViT (Visual Transformer), GPT2, CLIP.
- **GPU Stage**: Needed in model integration and training.

---

### 📕 **Stage 5: Advanced DL Projects**
#### 🔹 Project: Transformer-based Machine Translation
- **Use GPU**: Absolutely, Transformers are heavy.
- **Pretrained**: `Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt` (HuggingFace)
- **GPU Stage**: Training, fine-tuning, beam search decoding.

#### 🔹 Project: GANs (e.g., DeepFake, Image Synthesis)
- **Use GPU**: Training is intense (many epochs).
- **Pretrained**: StyleGAN2, BigGAN (on HuggingFace or repo).
- **GPU Stage**: Training & generating new images.

---

### 📙 **Stage 6: Custom + Research-level Models**
#### 🔹 Project: Custom LLM Finetuning
- **Use GPU**: YES. Massive RAM & VRAM needed.
- **Pretrained**: GPT-2, Mistral, LLaMA2 (on HuggingFace).
- **GPU Stage**: All phases (training, inference, quantization).

#### 🔹 Project: Video Processing with 3D CNNs or ViViT
- **Use GPU**: Video data is massive and needs GPU acceleration.
- **Pretrained**: ViViT, SlowFast models.
- **GPU Stage**: Training, feature extraction, real-time inference.
