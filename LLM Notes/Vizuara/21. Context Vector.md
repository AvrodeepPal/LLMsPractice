Absolutely! Let's walk step-by-step through the **entire process of generating a context vector** in the **simplified attention mechanism**, from raw input embeddings to the final context vector.

## 🧠 Goal
Given a sequence of tokens, for each token, compute a **context vector** that combines the meanings of all tokens, weighted by their relevance.

## 🧩 Step-by-Step: From Tokens to Context Vector

---

### 🔹 Step 1: **Input Embeddings**
You start with a sentence:
> `"The cat sat"`
Each word gets an embedding (vector) from an embedding layer.

Let’s say each token is embedded into 4-dimensional vectors:

```
X = [
  x₁ = [0.2, 0.5, 0.1, 0.7],   # "The"
  x₂ = [0.9, 0.1, 0.4, 0.6],   # "cat"
  x₃ = [0.3, 0.8, 0.2, 0.5]    # "sat"
]
```

---

### 🔹 Step 2: **Linear Projections → Q, K, V**
You create:
- Queries `Q = X × W_Q`
- Keys `K = X × W_K`
- Values `V = X × W_V`

Assume we project to 3 dimensions:

```
Q = [q₁, q₂, q₃]
K = [k₁, k₂, k₃]
V = [v₁, v₂, v₃]
```

These projections are learned during training.

---

### 🔹 Step 3: **Attention Scores (Dot Product)**
For each token `i`, compute dot product between its `qᵢ` and every `kⱼ`:

\[
\text{score}_{i,j} = q_i \cdot k_j
\]

This forms the **attention score matrix** `S`:
```
        "The"   "cat"   "sat"
"the"   s11     s12     s13
"cat"   s21     s22     s23
"sat"   s31     s32     s33
```
Each row = scores for how one token sees all tokens.

---

### 🔹 Step 4: **Scaling**
To prevent large dot product values:
\[
\text{scaled\_score}_{i,j} = \frac{q_i \cdot k_j}{\sqrt{d_k}}
\]
where `d_k` is the dimension of `K`.

---

### 🔹 Step 5: **Softmax → Attention Weights**
Apply softmax to each row (per token `i`):

\[
\alpha_{i,j} = \frac{e^{\text{scaled\_score}_{i,j}}}{\sum_{k=1}^{n} e^{\text{scaled\_score}_{i,k}}}
\]

This gives the **attention weight matrix** `A`:
```
        "The"   "cat"   "sat"
"the"   α11     α12     α13
"cat"   α21     α22     α23
"sat"   α31     α32     α33
```

- Each row is a **probability distribution**
- Each weight αᵢⱼ tells how much token `i` attends to token `j`

---

### 🔹 Step 6: **Compute Context Vectors (Weighted Sum of V)**
For each token `i`, compute its **context vector**:
\[
\text{context}_i = \sum_{j=1}^{n} \alpha_{i,j} \cdot v_j
\]

It’s a **weighted average** of the value vectors.

This gives the final output matrix:
```
Context = [
  c₁ = α₁₁*v₁ + α₁₂*v₂ + α₁₃*v₃,
  c₂ = α₂₁*v₁ + α₂₂*v₂ + α₂₃*v₃,
  c₃ = α₃₁*v₁ + α₃₂*v₂ + α₃₃*v₃
]
```

Q × Kᵀ → Score Matrix

Scale by √dₖ
      ↓
Softmax → Attention Weight Matrix (A)
      ↓
A × V → Context Vectors
```

Each **context vector** captures:
> “The meaning of a word, after attending to others, weighted by their relevance.”

---

## 🧠 Final Intuition

- `Q` = what this word is looking for
- `K` = what each word offers
- `Dot(Q, Kᵗ)` = compatibility (relevance)
- `Softmax` = normalize to get attention focus
- `V` = actual content
- `Weighted Sum` = get final meaning with context
