Great two-part question! Let's break it down into:

## 🔁 Why is GPT-3 an **Autoregressive** Model?

### 🧠 Definition: **Autoregressive Model**

An **autoregressive model** generates output **one token at a time**, where each new token is **conditioned on the previous tokens**.

> It learns the probability of the next word given all the previous ones:
> \[
P(x_t \mid x_1, x_2, ..., x_{t-1})
\]

---

### ✅ GPT-3 is Autoregressive Because:

- It's trained with **causal (unidirectional) self-attention**, meaning:
  - Each token can only "see" **past tokens**, not future ones.
- During training, GPT-3 learns to **predict the next word** in a sequence (causal language modeling).
- At inference, it generates tokens **one by one**, feeding each prediction back in as input.

> 📌 GPT-3 **can't fill in blanks** like BERT (which is bidirectional); it only goes left → right.

### ✏️ Example:

Prompt: `"The cat sat on the"`

- GPT-3 will predict the next token: `"mat"`, based on `"The cat sat on the"`

## 🆚 Zero-shot vs Few-shot Learning

| Concept             | **Zero-Shot Learning**                            | **Few-Shot Learning**                               |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 🔍 Definition         | Model performs task **without** seeing any examples | Model is shown a **few examples** in the prompt     |
| 📦 Example Provided? | ❌ None                                            | ✅ 1–5 examples in the prompt                       |
| 🧠 Requires Task Hints? | Yes (clear instructions in natural language)     | Less so—examples help guide behavior                |
| 🧪 GPT-3 Style Input | `"Translate to French: 'Good morning'"`           | `"English: Hello → French: Bonjour\nEnglish: Good morning → French:"` |
| 🧰 Used For          | Generalization to unseen tasks                    | Task adaptation with in-context examples            |
| 🎯 Accuracy          | Lower (without context)                          | Higher (with relevant examples)                     |

### 🔍 Example Comparison

#### 🔸 **Zero-Shot**
Prompt:
```
Translate to French: "Good morning"
```

> GPT-3 has **never seen examples**, but it tries using general knowledge.

#### 🔹 **Few-Shot**
Prompt:
```
Translate English to French:
English: Hello → French: Bonjour
English: Thank you → French: Merci
English: Good morning → French:
```

> GPT-3 sees a **few examples** in context and then generalizes better.

---

## 🧠 Summary:

- **GPT-3 is autoregressive**: generates tokens one-by-one, using only past context.
- **Zero-shot** = task with **no examples**, just instructions.
- **Few-shot** = task with **a few examples**, no parameter updates, just better prompts.
