Let's break this down and explain it step-by-step, then move on to a practical implementation of **Multihead Attention** using **weight splits**, **causal masking**, and **multiple matrices** (instead of repeating the same op).

## üîç What is Multihead Attention?

### 1. **Base idea: Scaled Dot-Product Attention**
Given:
- Queries (Q)
- Keys (K)
- Values (V)

The attention is computed as:

\[
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right) V
\]

---

### 2. **Multihead Attention**
Instead of using a single attention operation, we do it in **parallel across multiple "heads"**, each with its own learned projection.

If:
- Input dim = `d_model`
- Number of heads = `n_heads`
- Each head dim = `d_head = d_model / n_heads`

We split the Q, K, V matrices into `n_heads` slices:
- Each head gets its own **W_q**, **W_k**, **W_v** of shape `(d_model, d_head)`
- This allows the model to **attend to information from different representation subspaces**

Then:
- Run attention on each head separately
- Concatenate all outputs: shape `(batch, seq_len, d_model)`
- Apply final projection

---

### 3. **Causal Masking**
In decoder blocks (like in GPT), we **prevent each token from looking at future tokens.**
- Use an upper-triangular mask.
- This is applied before softmax: mask future logits with `-inf`.

---

## üîÑ Why it‚Äôs difficult
1. **Repetition**: If we naively loop over heads or apply separate attention ops, it‚Äôs **inefficient**.
2. **Matrix multiplication** is costly, especially when done per-head.
3. Better: **Split weights**, reshape tensors, use **batch matrix multiplication** to do attention for all heads in **parallel**.

---

## üß† Implementation Plan

Assume:
- Input: `x` of shape `(batch, seq_len, d_model)`
- `n_heads`: number of attention heads
- `d_head`: dimension per head
- `d_model = n_heads * d_head`

We‚Äôll:
1. Use **single big weight matrices** `W_q`, `W_k`, `W_v` of shape `(d_model, d_model)`
2. Multiply `x` to get full Q, K, V
3. Reshape to `(batch, n_heads, seq_len, d_head)`
4. Apply **causal masked softmax**
5. Do attention
6. Concatenate heads and apply final linear projection

## ‚úÖ PyTorch Implementation (with weight splits)

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class MultiheadSelfAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model, n_heads):
        super().__init__()
        assert d_model % n_heads == 0
        self.d_model = d_model
        self.n_heads = n_heads
        self.d_head = d_model // n_heads

        # Combined weight matrices for Q, K, V
        self.W_qkv = nn.Linear(d_model, 3 * d_model)
        # Output projection
        self.W_o = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)

    def forward(self, x):
        B, T, _ = x.shape

        # 1. Linear projection: [B, T, d_model] ‚Üí [B, T, 3*d_model]
        qkv = self.W_qkv(x)

        # 2. Split into Q, K, V then reshape: [B, T, 3*d_model] ‚Üí 3 √ó [B, n_heads, T, d_head]
        qkv = qkv.reshape(B, T, 3, self.n_heads, self.d_head)
        qkv = qkv.permute(2, 0, 3, 1, 4)  # [3, B, n_heads, T, d_head]
        Q, K, V = qkv[0], qkv[1], qkv[2]

        # 3. Scaled dot-product attention
        attn_scores = Q @ K.transpose(-2, -1) / self.d_head**0.5  # [B, n_heads, T, T]

        # 4. Causal mask
        mask = torch.triu(torch.ones(T, T, device=x.device), diagonal=1).bool()
        attn_scores.masked_fill_(mask, float('-inf'))

        # 5. Softmax + weighted sum
        attn_weights = F.softmax(attn_scores, dim=-1)
        out = attn_weights @ V  # [B, n_heads, T, d_head]

        # 6. Concatenate heads: [B, T, d_model]
        out = out.transpose(1, 2).reshape(B, T, self.d_model)

        # 7. Final linear projection
        return self.W_o(out)
```

## üîÅ How Causal Attention is Reused
Causal masking is applied **before softmax**, ensuring that each timestep `t` can only attend to positions `‚â§ t`.

Each head processes a **causal masked QK^T**, and since all heads use the same causal mask, it‚Äôs **reused across heads**, efficiently using `torch.triu`.

---

## üß† Summary

- Multihead attention projects input to Q, K, V using shared large matrices and then **splits** into multiple heads.
- Each head processes a slice of the Q/K/V tensors.
- Causal attention is just attention with an upper-triangular mask applied before softmax.
- Efficient implementation avoids per-head loops by reshaping and broadcasting.
